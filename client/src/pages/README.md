# Pages

The `client/src/pages` directory contains the main page components of the application. Each file in this directory corresponds to a specific page that a user can navigate to, such as the home page, user profile page, login page, etc.  

These page components are typically composed of multiple smaller components from the `client/src/components` directory. They also use service functions from the `client/src/services` directory to retrieve and display data.  

Each page component is associated with a specific route in the application's routing configuration (usually found in a `Routes.js` or `App.js` file). When a user navigates to a specific URL, the corresponding page component is rendered.  

This structure helps to keep the codebase organized and maintainable.

# Client Side Services

The `client/src/services` directory contains service functions that handle communication with the server-side of the application. Each file in this directory corresponds to a specific entity or feature of the application, such as users, posts, comments, etc.

These service functions use HTTP requests to communicate with the server. For example, a service function might send a `GET` request to the server to retrieve a list of users, or a `POST` request to create a new user.

These service functions are typically called by the components in the `client/src/components` directory. When a component needs to retrieve or modify data, it calls the appropriate service function.

This separation of concerns helps to keep the codebase clean and maintainable.

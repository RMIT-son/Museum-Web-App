# Assets

The `client/src/assets` directory contains static asset files used in the application. This can include images, icons, fonts, stylesheets, and other static files that are not directly related to the application's logic.  

These assets are typically imported and used in the components to enhance the user interface. For example, an image might be imported and used in a component to display a logo, or a stylesheet might be imported to apply global styles.  

This structure helps to keep the codebase organized by separating static assets from the application's logic.

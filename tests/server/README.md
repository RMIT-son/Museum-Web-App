# Server Side Code Tests

The `tests/server` directory contains all the test files for the server-side code of the application. Each file in this directory corresponds to a specific feature or entity of the application, such as users, posts, comments, etc.  

These tests are designed to verify the functionality and reliability of our server-side code. They ensure that the application behaves as expected when interacting with the database and handling client requests.  

To run these tests, use the command `npm test` from the root directory of the project.

# Client Side Code Tests

The `tests/client` directory contains all the test files for the client-side code of the application. Each file in this directory corresponds to a specific component or feature of the client-side application.  

These tests are designed to verify the functionality and reliability of our client-side code. They ensure that the application's user interface behaves as expected and that it correctly displays data and responds to user interactions.  

To run these tests, use the command `npm test` from the root directory of the project.

## Services

The `services` folder contains all the business logic for the application. Each file in this folder typically corresponds to a specific feature or functionality of the application.

For example, if the application has a feature for managing users, there might be a `userService.js` file in the `services` folder. This file would contain functions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting users.

These service functions are used by the route handlers in the `routes` folder. When a route handler receives a request, it calls the appropriate service function to perform the necessary business logic, then sends the response back to the client.

This separation of concerns makes the code easier to understand and maintain. It also makes it easier to test the application logic with unit tests and integration tests.

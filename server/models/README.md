# Models 
The `server/models` directory contains all the data models for the application. Each file in this directory corresponds to a specific entity in the application, such as a User, Post, Comment, etc.  

These models define the structure of the data entities, including the types and constraints of each attribute. They also define any relationships between entities, such as one-to-many or many-to-many relationships.  

In a MERN stack application, these models are typically used with Mongoose to interact with the MongoDB database. Each model corresponds to a collection in the database, and the model's structure corresponds to the schema of the documents in that collection.  

To interact with the database, the service functions in the `services` directory use these models to create, read, update, and delete documents in the database.

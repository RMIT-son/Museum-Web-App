# Middleware

The `server/middleware` directory contains middleware functions that are used in the application. Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.  

These functions can execute any code, make changes to the request and the response objects, end the request-response cycle, or call the next function in the stack.  

For example, middleware functions can be used for logging, error handling, authentication, etc. If a middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call `next()` to pass control to the next middleware function.  

To use a middleware function, it is typically imported in the `server/router` files and then added to the desired routes.
